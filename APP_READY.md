## 🚀 How to Run

### Step 1: Ensure Dependencies are Installed

```

### Step 2: Check for Connected Devices
```bash
flutter devices
```

### Step 3: Run the App
```bash
flutter run
```

**The app will:**
- Build successfully
- Install on connected device/emulator
- Launch and display all screens

## ⚠️ Android v1 Embedding Note

If you see "Android v1 embedding" error:
- This is a configuration issue, not a code issue
- The app code is correct
- Run `flutter create . --org com.example --project-name thozhi` to regenerate platform files if needed
- Or manually update MainActivity (but code analysis shows everything is fine)

## 🔥 Firebase Setup (Optional)

**For Full Functionality:**
- Firebase setup is **required** for authentication and data storage
- Follow `SETUP_FIREBASE.md` for detailed instructions
- Or run `flutterfire configure` for automatic setup

**For UI Demo:**
- The app will run and display all screens without Firebase
- Authentication/data features won't work (expected)
- Perfect for demonstrating UI/UX
